## For Package Maintainers:

When you add any functions to the package, make your changes in a separate Git branch, and submit a pull request (PR). As part of your changes, you should also add your name to the `DESCRIPTION` file (see below). You can also include a comment with your ORCID number if you like, in the `comment` field. To add your name use the following template and paste it into the `Authors@R:` field.

```         
person(
  given   = "Given name",
  family  = "Family name",
  email   = "email@example.com",
  role = "aut",
  comment = c(ORCID = "Optional - YOUR-ORCID-ID")
)
```

For example, inside the `c()` following `Authors@R:`

```         
Authors@R: c(
    person("John", "Wilson",
    email = "43386915+jmcvw@users.noreply.github.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
    )
```

Then, commit and push, and submit your PR. If PRs are new to you, maybe we can cover this in a future week?

**Extra notes:**

-   Please do not use `library()` **ANYWHERE** in the package.
    -   in particular don't do `library(tidyverse)`
    -   (For good reasons, not any kind of anti-tidyverse sentiment)
