Some helper functions for teaching.

When you add any functions to the package, also add your name to the `DESCRIPTION` file.
You can also include a comment with your ORCID number if you like, in the `comment` field.
To add your name use the following template and paste it into the `Authors@R:` field, inside the `c()`.

```
person(
  given   = "Given name",
  family  = "Family name",
  email   = "email@example.com", role = "aut",
  comment = c(ORCID = "Optional - YOUR-ORCID-ID")
)

```

Then, commit and push.


__Extra notes:__

- Please do not use `library()` __ANYWHERE__ in the package.
    - in particular don't do `library(tidyverse)`
