\usage{
take_attendance(
  full_class,
  present_students,
  file_path = NULL,
  session_id = NULL,
  append = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{full_class}{A character vector of student names or a data frame with a
\code{name} column.}

\item{present_students}{A numeric vector of indices corresponding to students
who were present. These indices should match the row numbers of
\code{full_class}.}

\item{file_path}{Optional. A file path (e.g., \code{"attendance.csv"}) where the
attendance record will be saved or appended.}

\item{session_id}{Optional. A label for the session (e.g., \code{"week1"}). If
\code{NULL}, the current date and time is used.}

\item{append}{Logical. If TRUE, appends to an existing file specified in
\code{file_path}. If FALSE, overwrites the file. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns: \code{name} (student name), \code{present} (logical),
and \code{session} (session ID).
}
\description{
This function creates and optionally saves a record of student attendance for
a given session. You provide a class list (as a character vector or data
frame with a \code{name} column), and index which students were present using
their row numbers. The result is a tibble containing student names, a logical
indicator of presence (\code{TRUE}/\code{FALSE}), and a session ID.
}
\details{
If no session ID is provided, the function automatically uses the current
date and time in the format \code{"dd-mm-yy_HHMM"}. You can optionally write the
output to a CSV file using the file_path argument. If append = FALSE
(default), the file will be created or overwritten. If append = TRUE, the new
attendance will be added to the bottom of an existing attendance log. This
allows you to accumulate attendance across sessions in a single file.
