\title{Taking student attendance}
\usage{
take_attendance(
  full_class,
  present_students,
  file_path = NULL,
  session_id = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{full_class}{A character vector of student names or a data frame with a
\code{name} column.}

\item{present_students}{A numeric vector of indices corresponding to students
who were present. These indices should match the row numbers of
\code{full_class}.}

\item{file_path}{Optional. A file path (e.g., \code{"attendance.csv"}) where the
attendance record will be saved or appended.}

\item{session_id}{Optional. A label for the session (e.g., \code{"week1"}). If
\code{NULL}, the current date and time is used.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns: \code{name} (student name), \code{present} (logical),
and \code{session} (session ID).
}
\description{
This function creates and optionally saves a record of student attendance for
a given session. You provide a class list (as a character vector or data
frame with a \code{name} column), and index which students were present using
their row numbers. The result is a tibble containing student names, a logical
indicator of presence (\code{TRUE}/\code{FALSE}), and a session ID.
}
\details{
If no session ID is provided, the function automatically uses the current
date and time in the format \code{"dd-mm-yy_HHMM"}. If \code{file_path} is provided,
the output will be automatically \strong{appended} to an existing file (if it
exists) or saved as a new file (if it doesn't), allowing you to accumulate
attendance records across sessions.

# Load USJudgeRatings dataset and use as full class list
class_list <- data.frame(id = 1:nrow(USJudgeRatings),
                         name = rownames(USJudgeRatings))

# print full class list to view row indices
print(class_list$name)

# week 1: take attendance. Suppose students 1:9, 15, 18, 20:22 are present.
attendance <- take_attendance(full_class = class_list,
                              present_students = c(1:9, 15, 18, 20:22),
                              session_id = "CourseX_Week1")

# week 2: take attendance. Suppose students 1:5, 12, 14 are present.
attendance <- take_attendance(full_class = class_list,
                              present_students = c(1:5, 12, 14),
                              session_id = "CourseX_Week2")

# You can also optionally save the attendance to csv file which is appended to each week
\dontrun{
# Save Week 1 to CSV (creates new file)

                         file_path = "attendance_log.csv")

# Append Week 2 to same file
